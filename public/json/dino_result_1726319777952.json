It lived around 150 million years ago in the Late Jurassic\n                Period, in an area\n                that is now North America.\n\n                Like all sauropods, Apatosaurus ate plants.\n\n                Young Apatosaurus individuals grew up quickly. They took around 10 years to reach full adult size.\n\n                Where did Apatosaurus live?\n                Apatosaurus lived alongside Stegosaurus, Diplodocus and Allosaurus.\n\n                Their fossils were found in the Morrison Formation, a sequence of rocks that covers a huge area spanning\n                several US\n                states, including Wyoming, Colorado and Montana. Many dinosaurs have been discovered there.\n\n                During the Late Jurassic the environment was semi-arid, with forests, rivers and floodplains. There were\n                distinct wet\n                and dry seasons.\n\n                How did Apatosaurus defend itself from predators?\n                Apatosaurus had a long, narrow tail that it might have used as a whip.\n\n                The animal's huge size would also have helped to protect it from smaller predators, which may have found\n                Apatosaurus too\n                big to take on. Living in herds gave extra protection.\n\n                What does Apatosaurus mean?\n                The name Apatosaurus comes from Greek words meaning 'deceptive lizard'. The scientist who named this\n                dinosaur, Othniel\n                Charles Marsh, felt that some of the fossil bones were confusing to identify. They seemed to resemble\n                the\n                bones of a sea\n                reptile.\n\n                Are Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus the same dinosaur?\n                For more than 100 years, most scientists stopped using the well-known dinosaur name Brontosaurus. They\n                thought that\n                Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus fossils were the same thing.\n\n                But based on a study done in 2015, experts now think that the two dinosaurs are separate after all,\n                although\n                they are\n                closely related.\n\n                When did Apatosaurus go extinct?\n                Apatosaurus went extinct 145 million years ago, at the end of the Jurassic Period.\n\n                Taxonomic details\n                Taxonomy:\n                Dinosauria, Saurischia, Sauropodomorpha, Sauropoda, Eusauropoda, Neosauropoda, Diplodocoidea,\n                Diplodocidae\n                Named by:\n                Marsh (1877)\n                Type species:\n                ajax",

It\n                was a kind of abelisaur, a group that also contains the well-known dinosaur Carnotaurus.\n\n                Rajasaurus sported a single short horn on the top of its head. No one knows for sure what it used this\n                horn\n                for, but\n                experts think it might have been for display or for head-butting other Rajasaurus.\n\n                Only parts of the skeleton of Rajasaurus have been found. But scientists have a good idea of what the\n                whole\n                animal may\n                have looked like as they have more complete fossils of some of its relatives, such as Majungasaurus.\n\n                Many abelisaurs had very short, stubby arms. It's likely that Rajasaurus did too, although we don't know\n                for\n                sure.\n\n                How big was Rajasaurus?\n                At 6.6 metres long, Rajasaurus was one of the larger members of the abelisaurid group. But this isn't\n                massive by Late\n                Cretaceous theropod standards. Dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus, Giganotosaurus and Carcharodontosaurus\n                could\n                get much\n                bigger.\n\n                What did Rajasaurus prey on?\n                Rajasaurus was likely an ambush predator able to bring down large animals with its strong neck and jaw\n                muscles. It may\n                also have scavenged for food. Unfortunately, scientists know little about the types of dinosaurs\n                Rajasaurus\n                preyed on.\n\n                Where was Rajasaurus found?\n                Rajasaurus was discovered in the Lameta Formation, a sequence of rocks formed during the Late\n                Cretaceous,\n                when India was\n                an island.\n\n                Sitting on top of these rocks are many layers of basalt, a type of rock formed from lava. These layers\n                are\n                called the\n                Deccan Traps. They were created by some of the largest volcanic eruptions ever.\n\n                Dinosaurs in India may have gone extinct around 350,000 years before the mass extinction event that\n                wiped\n                out most\n                dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous Period. This might have been due to volcanic eruptions.\n\n                Taxonomic details\n                Taxonomy:\n                Dinosauria, Saurischia, Theropoda, Neotheropoda, Ceratosauria, Neoceratosauria, Abelisauridae\n                Named by:\n                Wilson and colleagues (2003)\n                Type species:\n                narmadensis",
