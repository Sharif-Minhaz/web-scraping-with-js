# Web Scraping Project

This project demonstrates web scraping using `jsdom` and `Puppeteer`. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project.

## Installation

First, ensure you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your machine. Then, run the following command to install the necessary packages:

```sh
yarn install
```

## Running the Project

This project is set to run with [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime for improved performance so, if you don't want to use `bun` you can simple go to the `package.json` and modify `start` script like that:

```sh
# "start": "bun index.js",
"start": "node index.js"
```

To start the project, use the following command:

```sh
yarn start
```
